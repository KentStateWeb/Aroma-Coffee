  <h2> Our Story </h2>
    <p> With over ten years of experience in the industry, we source, roast, blend and serve the best coffee in Ohio. We offer a variety of estate
      and co-op coffees as well as a few select and specialized blends. We value the importance of fairness and quality at each step of the process
      from seed to cup.

  <h2> 01 </h2>
  <h3> Scout the best beans & buy at a fair price </h3>
    <p> Smaller is Better: Many of our specialty beans come from a single farm or even from a specific area on the farm, so they are limited in quantity and superior in quality.
We buy directly from the farmers and have established strong, long-term relationships, based on good coffee and fair prices.
    </p>

  <h2> 02 </h2>
  <h3> Roast with artistry and advanced technology </h3>
    <p> We specialize in small batch, air-cooled roasting. Our batch size (20-30 lbs. per batch)
    is small enough to give us good control and flexibility with our roast profile, and large
    enough to give a good amount of bean-to-bean radiant heat transfer and roast evenness. We
    exclusively air-cool our beans because water-quenching degrades flavor intensity and clarity.
    </p>

  <h2> 03 </h2>
  <h3> Control quality from grower to consumer </h3>
    <p> We personally source our beans, perfect them through the art/science of precision roasting,
      and supply them to select restaurants and retail establishments.</p>
